# Chief

## Laravel package
Chief does not interfere with the site logic which allows you to be in full control. It can be added to your laravel project as a package during development.

## Application config
With Chief there is no configuration held in database. Instead the project repository contains reference to all settings and thus kept in sync in your version control.

## Modular pages
Chief provides an optional pagebuilder. This allows customers to build pages in a easy to understand modular fashion.

## Why our own cms package?
Chief is a package based cms built on top of the laravel framework.
Chief is solely the back-end(admin panel). You will need to create the front-end yourself.
To install chief we need to install it into another project.
This can be either an existing one or a fresh Laravel 5.6+ project.
