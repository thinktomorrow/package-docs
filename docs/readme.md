# Why our own cms package?
Chief is a package based cms built on top of the laravel framework.
Chief is solely the back-end(admin panel). You will need to create the front-end yourself.
To install chief we need to install it into another project.
This can be either an existing one or a fresh Laravel 5.6+ project.
