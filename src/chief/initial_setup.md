# Installation
Chief is a laravel package that adds a site management system to your project.
Out of the box you'll get page, url and menu management provided a well-crafted admin ui. All of this with localization in mind.

## Requirements
There are a few minimum requirements for chief to be installable:
- php >= 7.2.0
- Laravel framework >= 5.6.39.

:::warning Potential vendor conflict
Chief makes use of the `spatie/laravel-permission` package. This does expect only one permission based role system. So this will present a conflict if your project
already utilises the package for its own permissions.
:::

## Installation
Chief can be installed via composer.

```php 
composer require thinktomorrow/chief
```

The package will automatically register its service provider but you'll need to set up a couple of elements to completely hook chief into your application:

1. [Migrations](#_1-migrations)
2. [Exception handler](#_2-exception-handler)
3. [Middleware](#_3-middleware)
4. [Chief config](#_4-chief-config)
5. [Chief assets](#_5-chief-assets)
6. [First admin user](#_6-first-admin-user)

### 1. Migrations

Run the migrate artisan command. This will automatically run the chief migrations as well.
```php
php artisan migrate
```


### 2. Exception handler
Your app's exception handler should extend `Thinktomorrow\Chief\App\Exceptions\Handler` since it takes care of all chief authentication and authorization.

In the `app/Exceptions/Handler.php` file extend the handler class as such:

```php
# app/Exceptions/Handler.php

use Thinktomorrow\Chief\App\Exceptions\Handler as ChiefExceptionHandler;

class Handler extends ChiefExceptionHandler
{
...
```

### 3. Middleware
Add the `\Thinktomorrow\Chief\App\Http\Middleware\AuthenticateChiefSession::class` middleware to your `App\Http\Kernel` file
in a `web-chief` middleware group:

```php{5-7}
# App\Http\Kernel.php

protected $middlewareGroups = [
    ...
    'web-chief' => [
            \Thinktomorrow\Chief\App\Http\Middleware\AuthenticateChiefSession::class,
    ],
    ...
]
```

In the same file add the following middlewares to the $routeMiddleware array.

```php
# App\Http\Kernel.php

protected $routeMiddleware = [
    'auth.superadmin'       => \Thinktomorrow\Chief\App\Http\Middleware\AuthenticateSuperadmin::class,
    'chief-guest'           => \Thinktomorrow\Chief\App\Http\Middleware\ChiefRedirectIfAuthenticated::class,
    'chief-validate-invite' => \Thinktomorrow\Chief\App\Http\Middleware\ChiefValidateInvite::class,
    'role'                  => \Spatie\Permission\Middlewares\RoleMiddleware::class,
    'permission'            => \Spatie\Permission\Middlewares\PermissionMiddleware::class,
    ...
];
```

::: warning Rename login routename to chief.back.login
From laravel version 5.7.19, there is an `App\Http\Middleware\Authenticate` middleware in the app folder which contains a predefined `login` route. This will break behaviour in cases where you don't have a `login` routename defined.
In order to redirect non-logged users to the chief login page, you should change this named route to `chief.back.login`.

If you have upgraded your project from an older version of Laravel you might not have this file.
Make sure to add it: [Authenticate.php](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/app/Http/Middleware/Authenticate.php)

In this class there is a redirectTo function and it should end up looking like this:

```php {6}
# App\Http\Middleware\Authenticate.php

protected function redirectTo($request)
    {
        if (!$request->expectsJson()) {
            return route('chief.back.login');
        }
    }
```
:::

### 4. Chief config

Publish the chief config to `config/thinktomorrow/chief` as this will require you to set some application defaults such as
contact email and application name.
```php
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=chief-config
```
Make sure to set at least the `name` value to your project name as it is used in some of the generator commands. Ideally this should match
the namespace of your `src` folder, if you have any. Make sure to namespace the src folder in your composer.json to match this name.

The following vendor assets should also be published to your application:
```php
// The dimsav translatable package
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=translatable
```

This will create the translatable config file `config/translatable.php`, this is where you edit what languages are available in the chief admin panel.


### 5. Chief assets
The next step is to publish the chief-assets to our public folder.
If you want to overwrite existing files you can add the `--force` flag here.

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=chief-assets
```

### 6. First admin user
By now your admin is ready to go. The only thing missing to access it is an admin user, so let's add one. Use the following command to
add an admin account. Note that it also takes care of setting up the auth permissions and roles.
```php
php artisan chief:admin --dev
```

Now that all this setup is done, let's go to the chief admin panel to get your first glance on the admin.
Go to the `/admin` route and login with your newly created credentials to access the admin panel.



## Connecting the site
For Chief to be able to render the admin pages, we need some routing work to be set up.

Out of the box, there are two project routes required by chief: `pages.show` and `pages.home`. You can [change these](./pages.md#using-a-custom-route-resolver) if you'd need to.
In your route file you should add the following:
```php
# routes/web.php

use \Thinktomorrow\Chief\Urls\ChiefResponse;

/**
 * Catch all Chief routing
 *
 * This catch-all will point to a generic chief response handler that answers the request
 * with the proper published model and view. It will handle the homepage '/' as well.
 * Place this at the end of the route file to ensure other routes are being found.
 */
Route::get('{slug?}', function($slug = '/'){
    return ChiefResponse::fromSlug($slug);
})->name('pages.show')->where('slug', '(.*)?');

```

### Chief controller
Besides the route definitions, we should add the following PagesController which will serve as the generic handler for all page requests.
You are free to create your own logic or extend according to your project. You can use the following code as a starting point.

```php
# App/Http/Controller/PagesController.php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\NotFoundHttpException;
use Thinktomorrow\Chief\Pages\Homepage;
use Thinktomorrow\Chief\Pages\Page;

class PagesController extends Controller
{
    public function show($slug)
    {
        if(!$page = Page::findPublishedBySlug($slug)) {
            throw new NotFoundHttpException('No published page found by slug ['.$slug.']');
        }

        if(Homepage::is($page)) {
            return redirect()->route('pages.home');
        }

        return $page->view();
    }

    public function homepage()
    {
        $page = Homepage::guess();

        return $page->view();
    }
}
```
### Chief view
Next, we'll need a default view that is responsible for displaying all managed pages. You can choose either `views/pages/show.blade.php` or `views/front/pages/show.blade.php`.
The one required method to render the chief content in the view is `$page->renderChildren()`.

So as a bare minimum the `pages.show` view should contain:
```php
# resources/views/pages/show.blade.php

{!! $page->renderChildren() !!}
```

### Registration
In the `app/Providers` folder add a file named `ChiefProjectServiceProvider`. This file can be used to register all your manageable models.
An example of this is:

```php
namespace App\Providers;

use Thinktomorrow\Chief\Pages\PageManager;
use Thinktomorrow\Chief\App\Providers\ChiefProjectServiceProvider as BaseChiefProjectServiceProvider;

class ChiefProjectServiceProvider extends BaseChiefProjectServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        // Boot core registrations
        parent::boot();

        // Example of registering event pages
        $this->registerPage('events', PageManager::class, \App\Events\Event::class);
    }
}
```

Make sure to add this service provider to your `config/app.php` file:
```php
\App\Providers\ChiefProjectServiceProvider::class,
```


### First page

Now let's click on pages in the navbar at the top and let's create our homepage.

### Homepage
Once you have added your pages, you should choose which one will be the homepage. This is currently set in the `thinktomorrow/chief-settings.php` config file.
Here you can explicitly set the page that is considered to be the website homepage. If this homepage value is left empty, the first **published** page is used as a default.

### Localization
When coding in Europe, you'll probably need to provide your site in more than one language. Localization is built into the core of Chief.
In order to manage the locales, you need to configure the following files:
- Set the available locales of the application in the `config/translatable.php` file. These are the locales in which each page should be made available.
- Set the frontend locales of the application in the `config/thinktomorrow/locale.php` file. These locales are available for the users of your application.
- Set the default and fallback locale in the `config/app.php` file. Keep in mind that this value needs to consist of one of the available locales as set in the `config/translatable.php`.

*Owkey looks like the basics are done and you are all set to kickstart your project development!*

## FAQ

### I get the "Route [login]Â not defined" error. Help!
Extend our ChiefExceptionHandler in the `app/handler.php` file. This is because the chief admin uses a custom guard and does not rely on the default auth laravel routes.

### I get the "Tokenmismatch" error after login into the admin. Help!
This most likely means you have an outdated version of chief. Run 'composer update' to get the latest version.
If this error persists you might have some middleware that's interfering with the login/session process.

### I get the "Class web-chief does not exist" error. Help!
Add the `AuthenticateChiefSession::class` middleware group to your `App\Http\Kernel.php` file.

### I get the 'Expected response code 250 but got code â530â, with message â530 5.7.1 Authentication required â' error. Help!
Please make sure your mail settings in your .env file are correct.

### MySQL index length bug
Add following snippet in the AppServiceProvider of your project if you use MySQL older than 5.7.7
ref: https://laravel.com/docs/master/migrations#creating-indexes
`Schema::defaultStringLength(191)`

```php
# App\Providers\AppServiceProvider.php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function boot()
{
    Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
}
```

## Local Chief development

For local development of chief we need another project to include the Chief package into since a package does not contain the whole laravel framework.
To set up the chief package for local development we link our local chief folder as a repository in the composer.json file.

Paste the following snippet in your composer.json file. This can be placed right above the 'require' section.
```php
"repositories":[
       {
           "url":"/full/path/to/chief",
           "type":"path",
           "options":{
               "symlinks":true
           }
       }
   ],
```
The url property needs to be the full path to the local version of the chief package.

Next install the local version of Chief. If you already had an installed chief in your vendor folder, make sure to remove it first, otherwise composer will not force the local symlink.
```php
composer require thinktomorrow/chief:"@dev"
``` 
Make sure your minimum stability of the application is set to `dev`.

To migrate and scaffold some entries you can run:
```php
php artisan chief:refresh
```
**Note that this will remove your existing database entries!**
